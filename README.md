## Disclosure


This game has been created to participate in the ["Game Jam pels ODS" (Gran CITM Game Jam - 4a Edició)](https://itch.io/jam/gran-citm-game-jam-4a-edicio).


It's a platformer with one level and a small tutorial, where the player can move right and left, jump and use abilities, while learning about otstanding scientist.


We want to spark more interest in games and other male-dominated fields for the non-male community, whose representation may be lacking.
